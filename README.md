This is my set of upgrades to a baseline 3018 CNC to support machining of wood for guitar necks, organ pipes, and other noisy bits.

## Overview
Playing music and making/modifying musical instruments has been a lifelong hobby of mine.  Electronic instruments have long been more accessible to DIY hobbyists given the increasing availability of custom printed circuit boards and the relatively low cost of basic electronic assembly tools.  3D printing and affordable hobbyist CNC machines have made construction of custom acoustic and electromechanical instruments more accessible than ever before.  

3D printing has been exciting, but available materials are not ideal for some acoustic applications (relatively high density and low stiffness compared to wood, for instance).  Laser cutting is a strong complementary technology, and K40 lasers have also achieved a <$500 USD price point, but these are largely limited to 2 dimensional cuts.  

A Genmitsu 3018 CNC has opened up new materials and geometries to me and had an initial price that was within my reach (<$200 USD).  The CAD and CAM learning curves proved considerably steeper than the SW tools for 3D printing, where large databases of free designs are readily available online and slicing SW is now relatively mature, general, and user-friendly.  And as I learned to use the 3018, its actual power, geometry, and accuracy proved to be quite constraining.  In particular, I was interested in being able to machine guitar necks from wood in less than a day of machining and without workpiece tiling.  As with lasers, there is a considerable price jump from the entry-level machines (~$200USD) to mid-level hobby machines (>$1000USD). 

My solution has been incremental upgrades, first to improve accuracy, then power, then machining volume.  The resulting machine appears to fill a capability and price point gap in the current commercial offerings (~$250USD beyond the baseline 3018 cost for 10x spindle power and a 1 meter y axis), so I've decided to share my set of upgrades for others to use if they please.
